## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Postcss Script
- Vanilla Js
- LeafLetJs APi
- GEOIP API

### What I learned
This is my first ever Js project to include an external API. I learned through the coding process how to interact with the behaviour of an API. I dived a little deep into the API docs to get to know some important concepts such as options inheritance among the API classes.

### Continued development
I plan on getting myself more aquainted with the use of the different API's out there as they contribute a lot in the performance of any kind of project.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me in how to use certain leafletJs option keys.
- (https://www.github.com) - Helped me solve some misuses I had with the API by checking its github's issues section.
